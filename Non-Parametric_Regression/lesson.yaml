- Class: text
  Output: In this tutorial we will present some techniques for the
    analysis of non-parametric regression with R. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Sometimes the spread of the data is so large that we cannot figure
    any linear relation between the variables or the pattern suggested 
    does not clearly correspond to a linear pattern or any other known
    function. So we can let the data talk by itself without imposing
    any funcional form to the association between y an x. There 
    are several tools in R for non-parametric regression.
    We have loaded a data set for you, with two variables, Y is the
    time in minutes that takes to perform a task by different teams, in a
    firm, and X is the number of members of each team. Take a look at the
    data frame using the head() function, the data frame is called "task".
  CorrectAnswer: head(task)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(task)')
  Hint: You have to enter "head(task)" to check the first cases of the "task"
    data frame.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We have saved the X and Y variables in the current R workspace, so
    that you can work with their names directly, without having to refer to
    the data frame name. Prepare a scatterplot of Y (time to finish a task)
    against X (number of members of the team), using the plot() function.
  CorrectAnswer: plot(Y~X)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(Y~X)')
  Hint: You have to enter "plot(Y~X)" to get a scatterplot of Y against X.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: According to what you see in the scatterplot
  AnswerChoices: there is a lot spread and it is hard to figure out the
    relation between the variables; there is a very clear positive association; there is a very clear negative association
  CorrectAnswer: there is a lot spread and it is hard to figure out the
    relation between the variables
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='there is a lot spread and it is hard to figure out the relation between the variables')
  Hint: As it can be seen in the data it is hard to figure out the relationship
    between Y and X.

- Class: figure
  Output: We have prepared the residual plot for the linear regression
    between Y and X for you. You can check it on the right window.
  Figure: figure_resid.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The residual plot shows
  AnswerChoices: a possible non-linear association; a possible linear association
  CorrectAnswer: a possible non-linear association
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='a possible non-linear association')
  Hint: For low values of X the residuals are positive, for intermediate values
    of X the residuals are negative, and for high values of X the residuals
    are positive again.

- Class: figure
  Output: We have drawn the scatterplot now with the regression line. We
    can see that the regression line does not fit well to the points in the
    scatterplot, and that it shows a very weak linear association.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'The first thing that we can try is to bin the X variable in 
    different groups and check the average Y within each group. We first
    create 3 groups for X, for teams with less than 6 members, 6 or less 
    than 10 members and more than 10 members. We can do this using the 
    mutate package of the dplyr package, which has been loaded, with the
    code: task <- mutate(task, bins = cut(X, breaks = c(0,5,9,14))). Try 
    this code now.'
  CorrectAnswer: tasks <- mutate(task, bins = cut(X, breaks = c(0,5,9,14)))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='task <- mutate(task, bins = cut(X, breaks = c(0,5,9,14)))')
  Hint: You have to enter "task <- mutate(task, bins = cut(X, breaks = c(0,5,9,14)))" to bin the values of X in three groups.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will now use the plotmeans function of the gplots package
    to obtain a binscatter for these data. We can do it with 
    plotmeans(Y~bins, data=task). Run this code now.
  CorrectAnswer: plotmeans(Y~bins, data=task)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plotmeans(Y~bins, data=task)')
  Hint: You have to enter "plotmeans(Y~bins, data=task)" to obtain a binscatter
    with 3 groups.

- Class: text
  Output: In the binscatter we can appreciate a non-linear pattern. An U 
    shaped relationship, with a minimum in the group 5 to 9 members. Groups
    with less or more members perform the task spending more time.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'It is also useful to represent the binscatter with the 
    scatterplot. For this we need to use the ggplot2 package, which
    can produce professional looking plot, but it is more complex than
    the base R plotting functions. We have loaded the package and we
    start constructin the binscatter. The first command creates the 
    object and sets a x-y graph. It is d <- ggplot(task,aes(X,Y)). 
    Enter it now.'
  CorrectAnswer: d <- ggplot(task,aes(X,Y))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='d <- ggplot(task,aes(X,Y))')
  Hint: You have to enter "d <- ggplot(task aes(X,Y))" to start
    constructing the plot.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Next, we add the points of the scatterplot to the object 
    with d <- d + geom_point().'
  CorrectAnswer: d <- d + geom_point()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='d <- d + geom_point()')
  Hint: You have to enter "d <- d <- d + geom_point()" to add
    the points of the scatterplot to the object.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'The next step consists in creating three bins in X and
    computing the mean of Y within these bins and connecting each 
    point with a line, : d <- d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, 
    bins=3, geom="line").'
  CorrectAnswer: d <- d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, bins=3, geom="line")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='d <- d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, bins=3, geom="line")')
  Hint: You have to enter "d <- d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, 
    bins=3, geom="line")" to compute the means and connect them with
    a line.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'And finally, we represent a point at each bin to show the mean within
    the bin and we show the plot: d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, bins=3, 
    geom="point")'
  CorrectAnswer: d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, bins=53, geom="point")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, bins=3, geom="point")')
  Hint: You have to enter "d + stat_summary_bin(fun = mean, 
    bins=3, geom="point")" to show points for the means and plot the graph.

- Class: text
  Output: We can see again the same pattern. The more efficient teams are
    medium sized teams.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will use now the "plotluck" package in R to smooth the variation
    of the dependent variable and get an idea of a possible non-linear
    relation between Y and X. For doing this the command is
    plotluck(task,Y~X), remembering that the name of the data frame is task,
    Y is the time to perform a task, and X is the number of members of the
    team which performs the task. Enter this command now.
  CorrectAnswer: plotluck(task,Y~X)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plotluck(task,Y~X)')
  Hint: You have to enter "plotluck(task,Y~X)" to get a trace of the relation
    between Y and X.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The number of members in the team which is optimal (it minimizes
    the time to perform the task) is approximately
  AnswerChoices: 6; 4; 10
  CorrectAnswer: 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='6')
  Hint: Check for which value of X the value of Y is at a minimum, according
    to the plots

- Class: text
  Output: This finishes the tutorial on some non-parametric regression tools
    with R, a useful technique to describe complex associations between 
    numerical variables.
